Here is a short description of the plugin. This should be no more than 150 characters. No markup here.

== Description ==

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.10.0-blue" alt="Current Version" />

Add your new plugin at [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Powered Wiki](https://github.com/WPBP/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Powered/wiki/Plugin-made-with-this-Boilerplate)!

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for stable.

Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used for displaying information about the plugin. In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt` is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk\'s `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
